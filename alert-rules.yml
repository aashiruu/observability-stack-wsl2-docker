Use this exact minimal version (safe & fully working):

```yaml
groups:
  - name: system-alerts
    rules:

      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: 100 - (avg by(instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[2m])) * 100) > 80
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          description: "CPU > 80% for more than 1 minute."

      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: (node_memory_Active_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100 > 85
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          description: "Memory usage crossed 85%."

      - alert: NodeExporterDown
        expr: up{job="node-exporter"} == 0
        for: 30s
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          description: "Node Exporter is down."

      - alert: LokiDown
        expr: up{job="loki"} == 0
        for: 30s
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          description: "Loki is not reachable."
